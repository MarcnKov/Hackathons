# Hackathons

VivaTech 2018
was the first hackathon I ever participated. Besides great hacking, managing, coding and networking experience our team composed of Dylan Maryk ([Dylan's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/dylanmaryk/)) and Sergey Smagleev (LI : [Sergeey's LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sergey-smagleev-988a1bb1/)), has won the second place in general category.

Over 24 hours we developed a prototype of an app that could predict electric vehicle range (left to go) taken into the accunt various pararameters e.g. weather conditions, incline, battery pack size, etc..
