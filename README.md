# Hackathons

**VivaTech 2018**
<br/>
was the first hackathon I ever participated. Besides great hacking, coding and networking experience our team composed of Dylan Maryk ([Dylan's GitHub](https://github.com/dylanmaryk)) and Sergey Smagleev ([Sergeey's GitHub](https://github.com/sergeysmagleev)) has won the second place in general category.
<br/>

Over 24 hours we developed a prototype of an app that could predict electric vehicle range (left to go) taken into the accunt various pararameters e.g. weather conditions, incline, battery pack size, etc..

**VivaTech 2019**

<br/>
Was the second hackathon I participated from the VivaTech edition. 

Together with @a_dudinskyi we've worked on the Eramet (http://www.eramet.com/) challenge which was related to the supply chain transparency in the mining and metal alloys industry. 

Over 24 hours we've developped an application to keep track of the mining products (specifically, metal ores) from its initial supply chain point (mining) until final destination (foundry plant). Concretely, Eramet faced a challenge of not having unified supply chain database that could permit to all departments acess and update data in a simple manner. 

Therefore, we've developed easy to use and interactie supply chain management app. On the top of that, we've implemented "insights" solution that would allow to get updates of the products during its supply chain. For example, we know that metal ore chemical consistuency should remain constant during its whole supply chain. In case, if metal ore batch would accidently be changed or falsly identified for another metal ore batch, our algorithm would notify specific department concerned with the issue.
