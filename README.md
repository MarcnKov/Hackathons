# Hackathons

**VivaTech 2018**
<br/>
was the first hackathon I ever participated. Besides great hacking, managing, coding and networking experience our team composed of Dylan Maryk ([Dylan's GitHub](https://github.com/dylanmaryk)) and Sergey Smagleev ([Sergeey's GitHub](https://github.com/sergeysmagleev)) has won the second place in general category.

Over 24 hours we developed a prototype of an app that could predict electric vehicle range (left to go) taken into the accunt various pararameters e.g. weather conditions, incline, battery pack size, etc..
